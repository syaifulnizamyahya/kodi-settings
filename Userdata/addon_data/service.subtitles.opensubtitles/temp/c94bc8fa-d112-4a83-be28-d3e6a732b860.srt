is in that first kiss.

- Absolutely.
- Yeah, I think, for us...

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,026
...kissing is pretty much
like an opening act.

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,780
I mean, it's like the stand-up comedian
you have to sit through...

What are we supposed
to be seeing here?

345
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:34,211
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

346
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,179
You know, if you tilt your head
to the left and relax your eyes...

347
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,636
...it kind of looks like an old potato.

348
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,060
Then don't do that, all right?

349
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,477
Monica?

350
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,231
What do you think?

351
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,904
Mm-hm.

352
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,532
Are you Welling up?

353
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,984
- No.
- You are.

354
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,445
- You are. You're Welling up.
- No, I'm not.

355
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,782
- You're gonna be an aunt.
- Oh, shut up.

356
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,417
Hi, Mindy.

357
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,711
Hi, it's Rachel.

358
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,711
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

359
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,588
Oh, yeah, yeah, he told me.

360
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,511
No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.

361
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,386
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

362
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,764
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out...

363
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:29,099
...and you guys end up getting
married and having kids and everything...

364
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,685
...I just hope they have his
old hairline and your old nose.

365
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,985
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now.
