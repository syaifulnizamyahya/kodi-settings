          
            
            Always on my own, living in the past
Always trying to be your man, as long as it may last
I think that you're my destiny and someone
Separate us
Always on the road, I'm missing you all night
Always trying to come back home, there's always something not right
But baby you're my destiny, I'll be there very soon
Now, what's your favourite movie?
'Cause I'll be coming home soon
We will be together, always and forever
I am on my way to visit you tonight
But the detail you don't know is that I'm staying for a while
And maybe I can never leave 'cause all I want is you
Now, what's your favourite movie? 'Cause I'll be coming home soon
We will be together, always and forever
I don't wanna lie girl, every time we touch girl
I've felt like I'm in heaven, always and forever
How could this ever, I wanted this
But now I am gone
I am in heaven and you are on earth
But I wanted to stay, I wanted to stay
Now, what's your favourite movie? 'Cause I still want to know that
We could be together, always and forever
And I'm singing this from heaven, 'cause baby I am waiting
For you to come and say that we are back together
I don't want to cry girl, missed you for so long girl
And we can be together, always and forever
