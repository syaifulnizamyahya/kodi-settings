1. Hollow
A mind lapse succumbed by fear
The framework fades then disappears
Unto my world this loneliness surrounds me

Trust foresees it's final wake
I close my eyes, it's breath I take
Denied and drained are years befallen from me

In these hours seized by memories
Reflective paths of light appear
I walk alone, I disappear

Now I watch you burn inside me
The truth is damned and empty
I breathe the ashes of your soul

That gives me silence, gives me peace
Gives me space, gives me release
In sullen thoughts, you make me feel so hollow

In these hours seized by memories
Reflective paths of light appear
I walk alone, I disappear

Tangled in this lifetime, tangled in it's sorrow
Moments of clarity, fade into tomorrow
Tangled in this madness, What was deep now shallow
If I believe in miracles, why do I feel so hollow

Change forced from disarray
Yesteryear wasted away
Sheltered from this shattered life within me

In these hours seized by memories
Reflective paths of light appear
I walk alone, I disappear

Tangled in this lifetime, tangled in it's sorrow
Moments of clarity, fade into tomorrow
Tangled in this madness, What was deep now shallow
If I believe in miracles, why do I feel so hollow

Now I see, truth in memories
Reflective paths have disappeared
I walk alone, I reappear

Tangled in this lifetime, tangled in it's sorrow
Moments of clarity, fade into tomorrow
Tangled in this madness, What was deep now shallow
If I believe in miracles, why do I feel so hollow

In darkest days, I'm on my own
Why do I feel so hollow
An open view, a fading soul
Why do I feel so hollow
If I believe the new and not the old
Why do I feel so hollow
I'm lost in truth from what was told
Why do I feel so hollow
