2. Hard To Say Goodbye
When I find you, you'll be waiting
Outside the door of a cheap hotel
There'll be nothing to come between us
It'll be our time and we'll use it well

Tongue-tied I'm a twisted man
Got a lot on my mind, try and understand
Show me what your love can do
Let your fingers do the talking
Let them work for you
Head back baby, close your eyes
When your legs start shaking I'll be on the rise
So hold tight 'cause we're moving fast
Keep the rhythm steady till the final blast

When the night is over
Don't you know it's hard to say goodbye
Cause my world is getting colder
And it's hard to live a lie
Hard to say goodbye

When you're hungry, I will feed you
I'll fill you up till you hit the floor
When you're lazy I will revive you
Drive you straight to heaven then I'm out the door

Tongue-tied I'm a twisted man
Got a lot on my mind, try and understand
Hold tight, I'll be back for you
Didn't wanna fall in love but I'll try something new

When the night is over
Don't you know it's hard to say goodbye
Cause my world is getting colder
And it's hard to live a lie
Hard to say goodbye
When the night is over
Don't you know it's hard to say goodbye
Cause my world is getting colder
And it's hard to live a lie
Hard to say goodbye

Love is the Healer
Takes you by the hand
And lets you fly
Whenever you're ready
Baby I'll be your man
And never say goodbye

When the night is over
Don't you know it's hard to say goodbye
Cause my world is getting colder
And it's hard to live a lie
When the night is over
Don't you know it's hard to say goodbye
Cause my world is getting colder
And it's hard to live a lie
Hard to say goodbye

Close your eyes
I'll take you there...
