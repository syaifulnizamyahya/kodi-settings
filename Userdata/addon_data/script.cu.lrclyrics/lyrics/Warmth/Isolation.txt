5. In Depression
Chased thru love
The warmth it gives can't reach me
Live in isolation
The cold inside mesmerizing me

Prayers denied
Makes the end complete
Restless wrestling
Allow me my sleep

The last try to enter my loneliness
Passing me by this tender touch of loveliness

Chased thru love
The warmth it gives can't reach me
Live in isolation
The cold inside mesmerizing me

Prayers denied
Makes the end complete
Restless wrestling
Allow me my sleep

Creep into the black void
Life I ignore I don't talk... anymore
