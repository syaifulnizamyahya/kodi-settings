5. Beneath The Waves
[Beneath The Waves]

[Daniel Gildenl√∂w:]
The water breaks the golden sunrays
Silver dances on the wave
But a memory...

I often dream about the old days
Playing hide and seek within the caves
But a memory...

[Bob Catley:]
I still feel the rising tides embrace me
Carrying me to a place unknown
But a memory...

I remember all the love they gave me
In this fluid world we call our home
But a memory...

[Anneke van Giersbergen, Floor Jansen:] Beneath the waves we were invincible
[Floor Jansen:] In a world without frontiers
[Anneke van Giersbergen:] World without walls
[Anneke van Giersbergen, Floor Jansen:] Beneath the waves we were inseparable
[Floor Jansen:] In a world without walls

[Steve Lee:]
Faces of cerulean oceans
Mirroring stars and sable skies
But a memory...

How I miss the sense of sweet emotions
Of a world so pure, devoid of cries
Blind a memory...

[Jorn Lande:] Beneath the waves we were unbeatable
[Floor Jansen:] In the silence of the sea;
[Jorn Lande:] In a world without frontiers
[Floor Jansen:] World without walls
[Jorn Lande:] Beneath the waves we were untouchable
[Floor Jansen:] In the kingdom of the free;
[Jorn Lande:] In a world without walls

[Steve Lee:] Beneath the waves we were invincible
[Floor Jansen:] In the silence of the sea;
[Steve Lee:] In a world without frontiers
[Floor Jansen:] World without walls
[Steve Lee:] Beneath the waves we were inseparable
[Floor Jansen:] In the kingdom of the free;
[Steve Lee:] In a world without walls

[Face The Facts]

[Hansi Kursch, Anneke van Giersbergen, Floor Jansen:]
Face the facts, there is no way back
Arise! It's time to act
Face the acts, our future is black
Our eyes were on the wrong track [x3]

[But A Memory...]

[Tom Englund:]
Water breaks the golden sunrays
Silver dances on the wave
But a memory...

I often dream about the old days
Playing hide and seek within the caves
But a memory...

[World Without Walls]

[Jorn Lande:] Beneath the waves we were unbeatable
[Floor Jansen:] In the silence of the sea
[Jorn Lande:] In a world without frontiers
[Floor Jansen:] World without walls
[Jorn Lande:] Beneath the waves we were untouchable
[Floor Jansen:] In our kingdom of the free
[Jorn Lande:] In a world without walls
[Floor Jansen:] World without walls
[Jorn Lande:] Beneath the waves we were invincible
[Floor Jansen:] In the silence of the sea
[Jorn Lande:] In a world without frontiers
Beneath the waves we were inseparable
[Floor Jansen:] In our kingdom of the free
[Jorn Lande:] In a world without walls
