          
            
            Theres a moment when you're still in the dark
Small explosions fire out from your heart
Just feels so unreal
When the nerves and the doubts disappear
When your head is clear from all fears
Just feels so unreal

In search of simple pleasures
We breath, we bleed and breed
We know we are animals
Believe in what we need

Lengths of time we leave to
Forget things, and move
They know what their doing
They've built the maps and everything

They'll take their part
We'll take our part
Then when we're angry
We'll take it all back
They'll take their part
We'll take our part
Then when we're angry
We'll take it all back

In the darkness, when you're met by yourself
No illusions just your mind and your health
Still feels so unreal
When the words said play around in your head
When your conscience takes away every breath
Still feels so unreal
